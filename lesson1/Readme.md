# Lesson 1

# What is a micro-controller
A is a computer embedded on a single chip soley for the purpose of handling IO (input/Output). With pin outs and ins.

# What is an Arduino?
An Arduino is a microcontroller, Arduino are coded in c very similar to the microbit.

# Why use a micro contoller over a computer.
1. Cost (micro controllers are cheaper than computers)
2. Power consumption, micro controllers require less power than computers.

# Why Arduino
1. Cost (Cost around: £1.71 per board)
2. BBC microbits are £13 per board.
3. You will sooner or later blow a micro controller destroying £2 not an issue destorying £13 scary.

# What is C language.
1. A C language variant is used in arduino.
2. C is the godfarther of modern day programming languages.
3. C was invented in 1974 by Dennis Ritchie.
4. Dennis Ritchie passed away in the zame year as Steve Jobs, There would not have been a Steve Jobs without Dennis Ritchie.

Micro Controllers are everywhere to home appliances to industrial machinaey to traffic lights.

# What is Serial Baud

1. The baud rate is the rate at which information is transferred in a communication channel. In the serial port context, "9600 baud" means that the serial port is capable of transferring a maximum of 9600 bits per second
2. In essecnce its how information is sent and received.

# Objective
Over the next few lessons we are going to leane how to use the Arduino to do a variety of things.
1. Flash a light.
2. Read sensor input.
3. Spin a motor.
4. Build a autonmouse obstacle avoiding robot like here.https://youtu.be/xrPiDkLb_2M

# What is the Arduino IDE.
1. IDE is an abbreviation for integrated development enviroment its the program we code in.
2. In Arduino our programs are reffered to as sketches. I think its a silly name aswell.

# Installing the Arduino IDE.
1. In the raspberry PI open the terminal.
   Shortcut(Ctrl+alt+t)
2. Type in ```sudo apt-get install arduino```
3. Wait for Install.

# Using Arduino
1. Open Arduino should be in programming.
